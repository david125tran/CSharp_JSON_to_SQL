# CSharp_to_SQL_dapper  
This project uses the the dapper mapper (an open-source object-relational mapping (ORM)  
library for .NET and .NET Core applications). I parse JSON data into string and then  
use the dapper library to inject it into a MS SQL table as TSQL code.  
  
Start by opening the "startSql.sql" file in Azure Data Studios.  Run this file 1x.  

Run the rest of the package in Windows Powershell.  From there, the JSON data will be  
mapped into the MS SQL database.
